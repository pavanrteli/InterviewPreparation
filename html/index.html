    on somepart like header or footer then android will try to speak and give them some information about the scrren

<!--------------------------------------------DOM------------------------------------------------------>
<!-- DOM is document object model. initially when browser requests for any website it receives js,html,css file
& this browser will not understand. so here browser has its interpreter which will parse the document initially 
and convert it into dom tree/objects and this dom representation allows us to manupulate dom such as structure,
styling, content etc and this we can do with the help of js. now this dom structure browser will understand
and starts painting for displaying website on screen. -->


<!-----------------------------------------------BOM-------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- BOM stands for Browser Object Model. It is a collection of objects that allow JavaScript to interact with
the browser, including the browser window, history, and location. 
Here are some of the most commonly used BOM objects:
Window:
The window object represents the browser window. It provides properties and methods for interacting with 
the window, such as its size, position, and title.
Document:
The document object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser. It provides 
properties and methods for interacting with the document, such as its title, body, and elements.
Navigator:
The navigator object provides information about the user's browser, such as its name, version, and 
operating system.
History:
The history object provides information about the user's browsing history, such as the list of pages that 
the user has visited.
Location:
The location object provides information about the current URL, such as its protocol, hostname, and 
pathname. 
even console.log and setTimeOut are browser properties-->


<!--------------------------------------Difference b/w DOM and BOM------------------------------------------->
<!-- dom - 1. its purpose is to show the representation of html or xml document where with the help of js we can 
         manupulate dom
      2. dom provides objects like document,element,node,attribute etc to developers to interact with dom
         elements.
      3. eg - accessing element in the dom and changing its content.
bom - 1. its purpose is to provide collection of objects and with the help of these objects js can talk with 
         browser.
      2. its provide various objects such as window, screen, document, navigator, history etc.
      3. eg - using window object in the bom to open new browser window. -->
